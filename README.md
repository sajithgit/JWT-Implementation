# JWT-Implementation
JWT Implementation with REST

This project is to demonstrate usage of JWT .
How subject and claim can be verified .
Two API are defined in the project generateTokan and validateToken

generateToken
This APi will accespt user details . Authentiacation can be implemented as per requirement.
On success JWT token is generated and response is sent

validateToken
APi will check the validity of the token

This is very crude way of implementing , however spring security provides
configuration to implement JWT using filters
